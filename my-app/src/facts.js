          <h1>This is live interfaces</h1>
          <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards can read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message – and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

          <h1>This is Machine Learning</h1>
          <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it.

          <h1>This is projection mapping</h1>
          <p>Projection mapping and spatial augmented reality is a projection technology used to turn objects into a display surface for video projection. This technique can add extra dimensions, optical illusions, or notions of movement onto static objects such as buildings, vehicles or indoor objects. Through specialised software, a two- or three-dimensional object is spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the real environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object.
